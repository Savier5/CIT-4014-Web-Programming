# CIT4014-Web-Programming
All the work completed in my Web Programming class at PLNU. I learned practical approaches to web development using either server-side or client-side scripting
languages, such as PHP, ASP, or JavaScript. While learning core language and implementing webpage-based scripting. The integration of databases, such as MySQL
or MS SQL where used as an additional depth of knowledge. In addition, the course introduced other forms of modern web-based protocols, such as XML, JSON, and
SOAP.
